# StockShaving Game

Stock shaving is a command line game where you trade stocks to try to make a profit.

Right now you simple run ```python run.py``` to kick off the game. There are no 3rd party library dependencies so have at it!

The controls are simple.

* ```b``` buys a share at market price
* ```s``` sells a share at market price
* ```n``` creates a limit buy at bid price
* ```d``` creates a limit sell at offer price
* ```x``` cancels all limit orders

Have fun!
